# Spyfall-in-times-of-Corona
Here you can find a small program that enables you to play the magnificent game spyfall with your friends in times of social distancing.

The repository contains a small python program that randomly distributes the respective roles and sends them to your friends per mail. When everone received their role, you may discuss via your favorite video chat program.

All you have to do is: 

1) Make a gmail account from where you want to send the mails to your friends.
2) Add the credentials from the sender email and add your friends' addresses
3) Every new round, run the program.
