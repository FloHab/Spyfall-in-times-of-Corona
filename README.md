# Spyfall-in-times-of-Corona
Here you can find a small program that enables you to play the magnificent game spyfall with your friends in times of social distancing.

The repository contains a small python program that randomly distributes the respective roles and sends them to your friends per mail. When everone received their role, you may discuss via your favorite video chat program.
